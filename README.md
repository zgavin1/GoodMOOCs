## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my App Academy Capstone project.
My app "GoodMoocs" is a clone of GoodReads built using Ruby on Rails
and React.js. I'm putting a twist on the content (online courses
rather than books), but the layout and functionality should be near
copies of GoodReads' website.



### Features

Features include creating an account, and then rating online courses
that you have taken. Once you have rated a few courses, the app
will calculate and display a list of suggested courses for you to take.
Users can also track courses in which they are enrolled, keep a status
and set reminders for important dates. Further down the road, I'm
hoping to implement course discussions.
